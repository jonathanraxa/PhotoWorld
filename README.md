------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mode 2: Show All Photos

Description: Displays all the markers of the photos you searched for in mode 1.
If you want to display all the markers at once instead of having to
individually click on each image to display its marker, mode
2 allows you to drop everything at once.

How to:
1) After filling in the search options and hitting “SUBMIT",
press "Show ALL Photos”. This will cause the application to
rain all the markers down from the sky and onto its location.
2) You can click on each marker individually and see
all of its contents just like in mode 1.
3) Sometimes however, there are multiple photos
in one geo-coordinate that are not necessarily
accessible due to the number of markers present at that one location.
The “Check Same Location” button allows the application to check which
markers have the same geo-location and then displaying them
within a slideshow with the information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mode 3: View Slideshow

Description: Mode three is the “slideshow” mode where the photos found from the thumbnail
are made into slideshow. Users can make a slideshow of the public photos found,
photosets, and may even save photos to play on a slideshow for later use.
They may even comment on the photo within the info window if they do so desire
to and the comment will be displayed on the slideshow.

How to:
1) Put in a search within the text boxes in mode 1.
2) Click “SUBMIT"
3) You will notice that below Mode 3: Slideshow, there will appear a link below the text that indicates that the slideshow is ready to be used upon clicking. BE SURE TO CLICK ON THE BLUE LINK. Due to bugs, only clicking on the words will cause the slideshow to appear. (see below)
4) Upon viewing the slideshow, in order to view the description of the image, you must first click on the image.
5) To play the slideshow, find the “play” icon on the bottom right-hand corner of the page
